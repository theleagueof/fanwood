Fanwood
========
_by [Barry Schwartz](http://www.crudfactory.com)_

Based on work of a famous Czech-American type designer of yesteryear. The package includes roman and italic.

For more information about the typeface, read this Wikipedia article: [link]

    Notes from Barry:
    
    Fanwood Text roman and italic are the same as Fanwood but slightly darker and reduced in contrast; I tailored it to increase readability on my Amazon Kindle 3 e-book reader.
